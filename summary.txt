Data Loading & Cleaning: Loaded historical trader data and a market sentiment index, then cleaned the data by removing invalid trades and standardizing timestamps.
NLP Sentiment Analysis: Applied the VADER sentiment analyzer to the 'classification' column to create a more nuanced, continuous vader_sentiment_score.
Feature Engineering:
Calculated daily volatility for each asset to measure price fluctuations.
Created 7-day rolling averages for PnL, volume, and sentiment to capture recent trends.
Generated 1-day lag features for PnL, volume, and sentiment to model temporal dependencies.
PnL Prediction Model:
Trained a RandomForestRegressor to predict daily Profit and Loss.
The most important features were rolling_7d_pnl, daily_volatility, and trade_count.
Sentiment Prediction Model:
Trained a RandomForestClassifier to predict the next day's market sentiment.
The most influential features were rolling_7d_volume, lag_1d_volume, and the vader_sentiment_score.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for both models.
This improved the PnL model's R-squared to 0.33 and the sentiment model's accuracy to 56.1%.
Actionable Insights: The analysis revealed that recent performance and volatility are key to predicting PnL, while trading volume is a strong leading indicator of sentiment changes.


features plot analysis:

The first plot, "Bitcoin Market Sentiment Score Over Time," shows the daily sentiment score of the Bitcoin market. The sentiment score ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). The plot shows that the market sentiment fluctuates significantly over time, with periods of high fear and high greed. This information can be used to understand the overall mood of the market and to make more informed trading decisions.

The second plot, "Distribution of Market Sentiment Classifications," shows the number of days that the market was in each of the five sentiment classifications: Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, and Extreme Greed. The plot shows that the market spends the most time in the "Fear" and "Greed" classifications, and the least time in the "Extreme Fear" and "Extreme Greed" classifications. This information can be used to understand the long-term sentiment of the market and to identify periods of extreme sentiment that may present trading opportunities

The third plot, "Distribution of Daily Total Closed PnL (All Traders)," shows the distribution of the total daily profit and loss for all traders. The plot shows that the distribution is centered around zero, which means that on most days, the total profit and loss for all traders is close to zero. However, there are a few days with very large profits and losses, which indicates that the market can be very volatile. This information can be used to understand the overall profitability of the market and to identify days with high volatility.

The fourth plot, "Distribution of Daily Total Volume Traded," shows the distribution of the total daily trading volume. The plot shows that the distribution is skewed to the right, which means that there are a few days with very high trading volume. This information can be used to identify days with high market activity, which may present trading opportunities.

The fifth plot, "Daily Total Closed PnL by Market Sentiment Classification," shows the distribution of the total daily profit and loss for each of the five sentiment classifications. The plot shows that the median profit and loss is close to zero for all sentiment classifications, which is consistent with the previous plot. However, the plot also shows that the range of profit and loss is much larger for the "Extreme Fear" and "Extreme Greed" classifications, which indicates that these are the most volatile periods in the market. This information can be used to identify periods of high risk and high reward.

The sixth plot, "Daily Total Volume Traded by Market Sentiment Classification," shows the distribution of the total daily trading volume for each of the five sentiment classifications. The plot shows that the trading volume is generally higher during periods of "Greed" and "Extreme Greed," which is consistent with the idea that people are more likely to trade when they are feeling optimistic about the market. This information can be used to identify periods of high market activity.

The seventh plot, "Correlation Matrix: Sentiment vs. Trader Metrics," shows the correlation between the sentiment score and various trader metrics, such as the total daily profit and loss, the total daily trading volume, and the number of unique traders. The plot shows that there is a weak positive correlation between the sentiment score and the total daily trading volume, which is consistent with the previous plot. The plot also shows that there is a weak negative correlation between the sentiment score and the total daily profit and loss, which means that traders tend to lose money when the market is feeling optimistic. This information can be used to understand the relationship between sentiment and trading behavior.

The next set of plots, "Individual Trader Analysis," shows the daily profit and loss, the distribution of profit and loss by sentiment, and the buy vs. sell trades by sentiment for the top 3 traders by total profit and loss. These plots show that the top traders have different trading strategies and that they are able to make money in different market conditions. This information can be used to understand the trading strategies of successful traders and to identify potential trading opportunities.
